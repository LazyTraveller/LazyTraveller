## Hi 👋 I'm Jerry He

Passionate **Frontend Engineer** turned **AI Application Developer** — building delightful user experiences and intelligent cross-platform applications.

### About Me 😄
- 🔭 **Currently** — Working at **Opal** (Shenzhen), where I'm deeply involved in developing **AI-powered applications** — from interactive frontends to intelligent features that leverage modern AI models and tools.
- 🌱 Previously spent several years at **[gmfe](https://github.com/gmfe)** — an open-source-minded team focused on high-quality component libraries, design systems, and large-scale frontend infrastructure.
- ⚡ I love turning complex ideas into clean, performant, and maintainable code — especially when it involves **AI + frontend**, cross-platform development, or creative user interactions.

### Core Technology Stack & Interests 🤔
- **Languages & Core** — JavaScript / TypeScript (strong typing advocate)
- **Frontend Frameworks & UI** — React (and its ecosystem), Svelte, React Native, Taro / Mini Programs (微信小程序), Flutter
- **Desktop & Tools** — Electron, WXT (Web Extensions), Vite, Webpack
- **Styling** — Tailwind CSS, styled-components, CSS-in-JS
- **Specialized Domains** — 
  - BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) integration
  - WiFi-based file transfer & real-time communication
  - Cross-platform app architecture (web + mobile + desktop)
  - AI frontend integration (chat UIs, real-time inference, prompt-driven interfaces)
- **Always Exploring** — Large Language Models frontends, AI agents, no-code/low-code AI workflows, performance optimization, and modern build tools

### A Bit More About My Journey
Started as a classic web frontend developer → fell in love with React & mobile mini-programs → dived into React Native & Flutter for true cross-platform → built desktop tools with Electron → now combining everything with **AI** to create smarter, more intuitive applications.

Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect UIs, optimizing bundle size for mini-programs, implementing secure BLE protocols, or designing conversational AI interfaces — I enjoy solving real user problems with elegant code.

😄 Pronouns: he/him  
⚡ Fun fact: I once built a mini-program that lets you transfer files over WiFi while controlling a smart light via BLE… just because I could.
